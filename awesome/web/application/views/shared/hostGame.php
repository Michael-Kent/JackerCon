Hosting a game is for if you wish to GM a game for the next jackercon, once you have created the game other users will be able to join in anticipation to play in your game.

Please understand that if you host a game, it is as though you have signed up for one with a face to face group, there are people on the other end expecting your attendance. If you can't make it for any reason, notify your GM and/or group.
