# jackercon

Jackercon is a project i have rushed out the last couple of months while working 40-60 hour weeks. Throughout the project i have learnt better ways to organise my code. what you will hopefully see now is regular commits updating the readability and conformity of my project.

I am in the middle of setting up a new development environment consisting of a <a href='https://www.vagrantup.com/'>vagrant</a> setup for executing my code locally on my windows machine. I used <a href="https://www.puphpet.com/">PuPHPet</a> to configuire this, and am currently trying to solve an issue with being unable to connect to the database. I obviously have also introduced Git to my environment to handle versioning and eventually deployment to the server.
